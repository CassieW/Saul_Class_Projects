Machine Learning Project Plan
1) Give it a title
Poker Advisor

2) Describe the problem for the audience who is not familiar with your field and terminology and (3) Why this problem is important or interesting?
Approximately 40 million people playing poker around the world! Of these, a majority of poker games happen online. The science and decision making behind poker hands has been studied. 
As a result of all this studying, people have calculated the probability of each hand based on the situation. However, with a game like poker, there is a human component where people bluff or are not cognizant of these probabilities and thus they play “imperfectly” or not according to correct probability. 
Using machine learning, we can try inputting a large amount of history from online poker game databases to build a program that recommends how to play a hand depending on the situation and the forum (e.g. Pokerstar users, a particular friend, etc.).

4) What is your input space?
In one example, my input space would be a set of conditions on a table. For example, it would show the current cards showing, the number of players, their chip stacks, the blinds, the pot size, and my current hand.

5) What is your output space?
The output space would include all possible decisions I could make (check, call, raise by X, and fold). 

6) Do you know any data available for your learning task?
As mentioned earlier, there are websites that have a large number of poker games stored in databases. Pokerstars has a history of played tournaments. You can also collect data from online games with friends, etc. to add to user-specific data sets. 

7) What learning paradigm you think you will use (supervised, unsupervised, ..)?
Since I would be providing large amounts of data sets and giving and input while looking for a desired output, I would be using supervised learning.
